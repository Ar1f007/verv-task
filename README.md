## Design Decisions
- Modular components: Feature-specific components are organized within their respective module directories for clarity and scalability.
- Client-side filtering: Since the API lacks native search/filtering support, debounce-based client-side filtering was implemented for optimized performance.
- Global State with Zustand: A lightweight and efficient choice for managing cart state globally.
- Skeleton Loading: Used to enhance perceived performance and eliminate layout shifts during data fetch.
- Toast Notifications: Feedback is provided on cart actions for better UX.
- Adaptive Categories UI:
    - Mobile: Horizontally scrollable sticky category bar.
    - Desktop: Vertically sticky category sidebar.
- Pagination: Custom pagination with support for selecting items per page, displaying current range info (e.g., ‚ÄúShowing 1‚Äì8 of 20‚Äù), and page navigation.

- Form Handling:
    - Used react-hook-form for performant and scalable form handling.
    - Used zod for schema validation. 
    - Created reusable TextField and SelectField components to standardize form inputs across the app.

## What could be improved
- URL-based Filtering: Current filtering is done client-side only. Lifting search, sort, and pagination states into the URL (via query params) would improve UX and shareability.
- Testing: Add unit and integration tests using tools like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure robustness and maintainability.
